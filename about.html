<p>Hi, I'm SATHISH , a budding front-end developer and second-year student at SRM University. With a foundation in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, I enjoy crafting responsive, visually appealing web pages that prioritize user experience.

    Iâ€™m passionate about exploring modern design trends and building websites that strike a balance between creativity and functionality. As I continue my learning journey, I aim to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and dive into frameworks like React to build more dynamic applications.
    
    My key strengths include:
    
    Crafting clean, responsive layouts with HTML and CSS
    Implementing interactive elements with JavaScript
    Bringing creativity and problem-solving to front-end challenges
    Currently, I'm eager to collaborate on projects, learn from industry professionals, and continue leveling up my front-end development skills.</p>
